*READ CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING*

Apart from sld and lcmp (which should work on your system), atalanta and abc will only work if they have been installed before.

In case abc and atalanta have not been installed, review the steps mentioned in the following Github directories:

https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc
https://github.com/hsluoyz/Atalanta

In addition, you must do a fresh install of neos from the following web link:

https://bitbucket.org/kavehshm/neos/src/master/

If you see the message of permission denied for sld and lcmp, do the following:

chmod +x sld
chmod +x lcmp

After these two steps, invoke sld (./sld) and lcmp (./lcmp).
